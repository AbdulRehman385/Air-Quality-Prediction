# Air Quality Prediction

This project predicts air quality using machine learning models and is deployed as a Streamlit web application. The deployed app allows users to interact with the model and make predictions based on input features.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Training machine learning models to predict air quality.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics.
- **Web Deployment**: Deploying the application using Streamlit.

You can access the deployed application [here](https://air-quality-prediction-fzmznvzbdhvqqth68mxxee.streamlit.app/).
